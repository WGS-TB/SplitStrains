# splitStrains

### TODO:
1) Need to run a check on the gff file (version).  
2) Separate *splitStrains* code into files.
### Notes:    
Make sure that BAM's aligned sequences and indexed fasta reference have the same sequence ID.  
For example, if BAM aligned sequences refer to "*gi|41353971|emb|AL123456.2|* " then the fasta reference file should start with "*>gi|41353971|emb|AL123456.2|* ".
